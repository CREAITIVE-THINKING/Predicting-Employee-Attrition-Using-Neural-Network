Notebook Overview: attrition.ipynb
This Jupyter notebook is structured to handle a machine learning task involving employee attrition and department classification using neural networks. The notebook is well-organized into distinct sections with clear objectives and methodologies outlined in each step.

Part 1: Preprocessing
Data Importation: The notebook starts by importing necessary libraries and the dataset from a specified URL. The initial few rows of the dataset are displayed to understand the data structure.
Data Inspection: It includes code to determine the number of unique values in each column, which helps in understanding the diversity of data.
Target and Feature Selection:
The target variables Attrition and Department are isolated into a new DataFrame y_df.
A selection of at least 10 columns is made to serve as features (X data), excluding the target columns to avoid data leakage.
Data Splitting and Conversion:
The data is split into training and testing sets.
The feature data (X_df) undergoes transformations to convert categories to numeric types using mappings for binary variables (e.g., OverTime is converted to 0 or 1).
The StandardScaler is applied to scale the feature data, ensuring that the model is not biased by the scale of the data.
One-Hot Encoding:
OneHotEncoder is used for the Department and Attrition columns to transform categorical labels into a format suitable for model training.
Part 2: Create, Compile, and Train the Model
Model Architecture:
The notebook defines a neural network model using the Functional API to create two separate output layers for predicting Department and Attrition.
Shared layers are utilized, demonstrating an understanding of feature extraction that can be commonly learned from the input data before branching out to specific tasks.
Separate branches for each target variable are defined, each with its own hidden layers and output configuration.
Model Compilation:
The model is compiled with distinct loss functions for each output, optimizing each task based on its nature (categorical_crossentropy for multi-class classification and binary_crossentropy for binary classification).
Accuracy metrics are used for both outputs to evaluate the performance during training and testing.
Model Training and Evaluation:
The model is trained on the preprocessed data, and evaluation is performed on the testing set. The accuracy for both outputs (Department and Attrition) is calculated and displayed.
Part 3: Summary and Discussion
Questions are addressed regarding the suitability of accuracy as a metric, choice of activation functions, and potential improvements for the model. This section highlights a critical analysis of the model performance and theoretical considerations in machine learning tasks.
Conclusions
The notebook demonstrates a thorough approach to solving a multi-output classification problem using neural networks. It showcases skills in data preprocessing, model architecture design using advanced techniques like shared layers and multiple outputs, and critical evaluation of model performance.
