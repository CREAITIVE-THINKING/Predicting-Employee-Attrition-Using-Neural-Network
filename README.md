# Notebook Overview: 

This Jupyter notebook tackles a machine learning challenge involving employee attrition and department classification using neural networks. It is structured into clear sections with specific objectives and methods outlined at each step.

## Part 1: Preprocessing

### Data Importation
- **Libraries and Dataset**: Imports necessary libraries and the dataset from a specified URL, displaying the initial few rows to understand the data structure.

### Data Inspection
- **Unique Values**: Code to determine the number of unique values in each column, aiding in understanding data diversity.

### Target and Feature Selection
- **Targets and Features**: Isolates the target variables `Attrition` and `Department` into a new DataFrame `y_df`. Selects at least 10 columns as features (X data), excluding target columns to avoid data leakage.

### Data Splitting and Conversion
- **Splitting Data**: Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- **Data Conversion**: Transforms feature data (`X_df`) to convert categories to numeric types and scales the data using `StandardScaler`.

### One-Hot Encoding
- **Encoding**: Applies OneHotEncoder to the `Department` and `Attrition` columns, transforming categorical labels into a format suitable for model training.

## Part 2: Create, Compile, and Train the Model

### Model Architecture
- **Functional API**: Defines a neural network model with two separate output layers for `Department` and `Attrition` predictions using shared layers before branching out to specific tasks.

### Model Compilation
- **Loss Functions**: Compiles the model with distinct loss functions for each output (`categorical_crossentropy` and `binary_crossentropy`) and uses accuracy metrics for evaluation.

### Model Training and Evaluation
- **Training and Testing**: Trains the model on the preprocessed data, performs evaluation on the testing set, and calculates the accuracy for both outputs.

## Part 3: Summary and Discussion

- **Critical Questions**: Addresses the suitability of accuracy as a metric, the choice of activation functions, and potential model improvements, highlighting critical analysis of model performance and theoretical considerations.

## Conclusions

The notebook demonstrates a comprehensive approach to solving a multi-output classification problem using neural networks, showcasing skills in data preprocessing, model architecture design, and critical evaluation of model performance.
